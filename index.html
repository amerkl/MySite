                </div>
                <p class="lead mb-5">As a recent technology graduate I tend to go by this motto: "If at first, you don't
                    succeed;
                    call it version 1.0!" My name is Anna Merkl and I am a native of Lafayette, LA, and a
                    hard-working and passionate recent graduate of Louisiana State University's Information
                    Systems and Decision Sciences program at the E. J. Ourso College of Business and
                    Ogden Honors College. I was previously employed at Goldman Sachs as a Summer Analyst
                    in the Dallas and New York City offices where my primary job function was optimizing
                    systems and creating innovative and dynamic analytics solutions for the teams I served.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">One of the things that I love the most about being a technology professional is
                    that
                    there is unlimited potential to pair our knowledge with our passions. Two of my greatest
                    passions in life are music and helping grow others, and as you can see throughout my
                    experience and course work, any time I can I try to focus on exactly those areas. Whether
                    it is my comprehensive research study on the relationship between technology and music,
                    or my experiences founding the teaching assistant program for the introductory ISDS course
                    that has assisted 1500 students to date or the creation of the Diversity and Inclusion
                    Council within the Beta Chi Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, those passions are always at the
                    core of what I do. If you love talking about Analytics, Music Insights, Human Capital, or
                    even life in general, feel free to message me! I always enjoy working with others and
                    learning from there perspectives and experiences!

                        <p>My current position as an Associate Information Security Analyst has been unmatched due to
                            the large amount of change that we all have experienced from 2020. Due to COVID-19, my
                            team went from an in house group to moving completely online with many of us moving to
                            different cities and states along the way. Having the experience of working both in house
                            and remotely has allowed me to have the opportunity to grow my communication skills not
                            only with my team but also with the clients I serve on a day to day basis which is a vital
                            skill for success in any career moving forward. This position has also helped me grow my
                            overall technology experience by introducing me to the world of Cyber Security which is
                            going to be crucial for any technology company moving forward.</p>
                        <p> As an Associate Information Security Analyst I perform remote social engineering with
                            Financial Services clients
                            including Phishing and Vishing testing, conduct vulnerability assessment scans on internal
                            and external networks to identify client vulnerabilities, administer external penetration
                            testing to test the success rate of brute force attacks on client systems, diagnose policy
                            reviews
                            and compare existing security policies against top industry standards, and communicate with
                            key
                            stakeholders of projects, including clients and Project Managers.</p>

                        <p>During my Senior Capstone course at Louisiana State University, my team and I were
                            selected to work with an LSU student-run music startup called Revibe. Revibe is a
                            music application that allows artists to create playlists across multiple music
                            platforms including Spotify, Youtube, and more while also allowing artists to
                            upload their songs to the Revibe platform where they can do everything from
                            selling merchandise to having access to analytic insights on how they are
                            performing on the platform. For our project, our team was tasked with creating a
                            dashboard that Revibe Executives could show to potential investors that showed
                            their growth as a company and their music industry-specific statistics.</p>
                        <p>During my time as Project Manager for Investor Analytics at Revibe,
                            I defined the data needed for the project, led the analysis, and provided
                            the client with specific strategic recommendations, applied contextual
                            knowledge about artists and the music industry into our data analysis and
                            interpretation, managed a team of 5 students for 20 weeks to ensure project
                            success through adaptation and strategic delegation, developed a detailed
                            project plan with CEO and CTO of Revibe to monitor and track the progress of
                            the project, and was honored as Capstone Project Winner from LSU College of
                            Business for design and impact created with Revibe’s Internal Metrics
                            Dashboard.

                        <p> As part of my College Honors completion, I was asked to complete extensive research and
                            a hands-on independent study where I answered a question within my major through
                            methods I have learned in my studies. For me, a dream of mine has always been to
                            work in the music industry, and I wanted to dig a little deeper into the
                            relationship the music industry has with technology, as well as what we can
                            expect moving forward.</p>
                        <p>During this project I collected, prepared, and explored a
                            variety of music data, and constructed new methods to draw insight from this
                            data, communicated with various business and music professionals to gather
                            information and create industry insights, completed a comprehensive research
                            study on technology’s impact on the music industry from 1877 to 2020, presented
                            research findings and insights to a board of 3 technology and music professionals
                            and 100 students, and utilized Python, R, Excel, SQL, and Tableau to create
                            effective and insightful dashboards to demonstrate research findings.

                        <p>In my sophomore year at LSU, I applied to Goldman Sachs as an Operations Summer
                            Analyst in Dallas, TX, and lucky for me that appeared to work out rather well!
                            During my time in the Dallas office, I worked with the Mortgage Loan Servicing
                            team within the operations division and assisted with many reporting functions as
                            well as data visualization projects. At the end of the summer, my managers
                            approached me and said that they thought I would be a great candidate for their
                            Corporate Headquarters located in New York City, and lucky for me the New York
                            City team thought I would be a great fit as well! This led me to my second
                            internship with Goldman Sachs during the Summer of 2019 where I interned with
                            the Urban Investment Group, Merchant Banking Division, and Special Situations
                            Groups. My primary function on this team was to look for opportunities for
                            automation as well as develop a sophisticated dashboard for the teams to use for
                            tracking their progress. </p>
                        <p>Below are just a few of the things I am most proud of completing during my two summers at

                <p>I have found that I have a true passion for helping others and my hope is to utilize the analytics
                    and information technology skills that I have learned to impact the communities around me and
                    continue to grow my own "deep learning" by adapting, absorbing, and collaborating with other
                    professionals. I am a data-driven and insightful analyst who is passionate about Music Business,
                    Human Capital, and Global Investing. My joy in my career so far has come from creating cutting
                    edge dynamic analytics solutions for companies and watching how those solutions directly impact
                    consumers and the world around them on a daily basis.</p>
                <p> As for my noncareer based interests, when I'm not researching the latest trends in the music
                    industry or sharpening my analytics skills,
                    I'm working on improving old recipes, singing and playing piano, watching Friends or documentaries,
                    listening to books on Audible, or spending time with my friends and family.
